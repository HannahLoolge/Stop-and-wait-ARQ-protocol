of one in love_.

KING.                                    [_Sighing thoughtfully_.

  The holy sage possesses magic power
  In virtue of his penance; she, his ward,
  Under the shadow of his tutelage,
  Rests in security, I know it well;
  Yet sooner shall the rushing cataract
  In foaming eddies re-ascend the steep,
  Than my fond heart turn back from its pursuit.

God of love! God of the flowery shafts [47]! we lovers are cruelly
deceived by thee, and by the Moon, however deserving of confidence
you may both appear.

  For not to us do these thine arrows seem
  Pointed with tender flowerets; not to us
  Doth the pale Moon irradiate the earth
  With beams of silver fraught with cooling dews;
  But on our fevered frames the moon-beams fall
  Like darts of fire, and every flower-tipt shaft
  Of Káma[47], as it probes our throbbing hearts,
  Seems to be barbed with hardest adamant.

Adorable god of love! hast thou no pity for me?

[_In a tone of anguish_.]

How can thy arrows be so sharp when they are pointed with
flowers? Ah! I know the reason:

  E'en now in thine unbodied essence lurks
  The fire of [S']iva's anger[48], like the flame
  That ever hidden in the secret depths
  Of ocean, smoulders there unseen[49]. How else
  Could'st thou, all immaterial as thou art,
  Inflame our hearts thus fiercely?--thou, whose form
  Was scorched to ashes by a sudden flash
  From the offended god's terrific eye.

Yet, methinks,

  Welcome this anguish, welcome to my heart
  These rankling wounds inflicted by the god,
  Who on his scutcheon bears the monster-fish[50]
  Slain by his prowess; welcome death itself,
  So that, commissioned by the lord of love,
  This fair one be my executioner.
  Adorable divinity! Can I by no reproaches excite your commiseration?
  Have I not daily offered at thy shrine
  Innumerable vows, the only food
  Of thine ethereal essence? Are my prayers
  Thus to be slighted? Is it meet that thou
  Should'st aim thy shafts at thy true votary's heart,
  Drawing thy bow-string even to thy ear?

[_Pacing up and down in a melancholy manner_.]

Now that the holy men have completed their rites, and have no
more need of my services, how shall I dispel my melancholy?

[_Sighing_.]

I have but one resource. Oh for another sight of the Idol of my
soul! I will seek her.

[_Glancing at the sun_.]

In all probability, as the sun's heat is now at its height,
[S']akoontalá is passing her time under the shade of the bowers on
the banks of the Máliní, attended by her maidens. I will go and
look for her there.

[_Walking and looking about_.]

I suspect the fair one has but just passed by this avenue of
young trees.

  Here, as she tripped along, her fingers plucked
  The opening buds; these lacerated plants,
  Shorn of their fairest blossoms by her hand,
  Seem like dismembered trunks, whose recent wounds
  Are still unclosed; while from the bleeding socket
  Of many a severed stalk, the milky juice
  Still slowly trickles, and betrays her path.

[_Feeling a breeze_.]

What a delicious breeze meets me in this spot!

  Here may the zephyr, fragrant with the scent
  Of lotuses, and laden with the spray
  Caught from the waters of the rippling stream,
  Fold in its close embrace my fevered limbs.

[_Walking and looking about_.]

She must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of this arbour of
overhanging creepers enclosed by plantations of cane;

[_Looking down_.]

  For at the entrance here I plainly see
  A line of footsteps printed in the sand.
  Here are the fresh impressions of her feet;
  Their well-known outline faintly marked in front,
  More deeply towards the heel; betokening
  The graceful undulation of her gait[51].

I will peep through those branches.

 [_Walking and looking. With transport_.]

Ah! now my eyes are gratified by an entrancing sight. Yonder is
the beloved of my heart reclining on a rock strewn with flowers,
and attended by her two friends. How fortunate! Concealed behind
the leaves, I will listen to their conversation, without raising
their suspicions.

                          [_Stands concealed, and gazes at them_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ _and her two attendants, holding fans in their hands,
are discovered as described_.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

                         [_Fanning her. In a tone of affection_.

Dearest [S']akoontalá, is the breeze raised by these broad
lotus-leaves refreshing to you?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Dear friends, why should you trouble yourselves to fan me?

[PRIYAMVADÁ _and_ ANASÚYÁ _look sorrowfully at one another_.

KING.

[S']akoontalá seems indeed to be seriously ill.

[_Thoughtfully_.]

Can it be the intensity of the heat that has affected her? or
does my heart suggest the true cause of her malady?

[_Gazing at her passionately_.]

Why should I doubt it?

  The maiden's spotless bosom is o'erspread
  With cooling balsam; on her slender arm
  Her only bracelet, twined with lotus-stalks,
  Hangs loose and withered; her recumbent form
  Betokens languor. Ne'er could noon-day sun
  Inflict such fair disorder on a maid--
  No, love, and love alone, is here to blame.


PRIYAMVADÁ.                                  [_Aside to_ ANASÚYÁ.

I have observed, Anasúyá, that [S']akoontalá has been indisposed
ever since her first interview with King Dushyanta. Depend upon
it, her ailment is to be traced to that source.

ANASÚYÁ.

The same suspicion, dear, has crossed my mind. But I will at once
ask her and ascertain the truth.

[_Aloud_.]

Dear [S']akoontalá, I am about to put a question to you. Your
indisposition is really very serious.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                       [_Half rising from her couch_.

What were you going to ask?

ANASÚYÁ.

We know very little about love-matters, dear [S']akoontalá; but for
all that, I cannot help suspecting your present state to be
something similar to that of the lovers we have heard about in
romances. Tell us frankly what is the cause of your disorder. It
is useless to apply a remedy, until the disease be understood.

KING.

Anasúyá bears me out in my suspicion.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                            [_Aside_.

I am, indeed, deeply in love; but cannot rashly
disclose my passion to these young girls.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

What Anasúyá says, dear [S']akoontalá, is very just. Why give so
little heed to your ailment? Every day you are becoming thinner;
though I must confess your complexion is still as beautiful as
ever.

KING.

Priyamvadá speaks most truly.

  Sunk is her velvet cheek; her wasted bosom
  Loses its fulness; e'en her slender waist
  Grows more attenuate; her face is wan,
  Her shoulders droop;--as when the vernal blasts
  Sear the young blossoms of the Mádhaví[52],
  Blighting their bloom; so mournful is the change.
  Yet in its sadness, fascinating still,
  Inflicted by the mighty lord of love
  On the fair figure of the hermit's daughter.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Dear friends, to no one would I rather reveal the nature of my
malady than to you; but I should only be troubling you.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

Nay, this is the very point about which we are so solicitous.
Sorrow shared with affectionate friends is relieved of half its
poignancy.

KING.

  Pressed by the partners of her joys and griefs,
  Her much beloved companions, to reveal
  The cherished secret locked within her breast,
  She needs must utter it; although her looks
  Encourage me to hope, my bosom throbs
  As anxiously I listen for her answer.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Know then, dear friends, that from the first moment the
illustrious Prince who is the guardian of our sacred grove
presented himself to my sight--

                            [_Stops short, and appears confused_.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

Say on, dear [S']akoontalá, say on.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Ever since that happy moment, my heart's affections have been
fixed upon him, and my energies of mind and body have all
deserted me, as you see.

KING.                                            [_With rapture_.

Her own lips have uttered the words I most longed to hear.

  Love lit the flame, and Love himself allays
  My burning fever, as when gathering clouds
  Rise o'er the earth in summer's dazzling noon,
  And grateful showers dispel the morning heat.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

You must consent, then, dear friends, to contrive some means by
which I may find favour with the King, or you will have ere long
to assist at my funeral.

KING.

Enough! These words remove all my doubts.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                                  [_Aside to_ ANASÚYÁ.

She is far gone in love, dear Anasúyá, and no time ought to be
lost. Since she has fixed her affections on a monarch who is the
ornament of Puru's line, we need not hesitate for a moment to
express our approval.

ANASÚYÁ.

I quite agree with you.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                                             [_Aloud_.

We wish you joy, dear [S']akoontalá. Your affections are fixed on an
object in every respect worthy of you,. The noblest river will unite itself
to the ocean, and the lovely Mádhaví-creeper clings naturally to the
Mango, the only tree capable of supporting it.

KING.

Why need we wonder if the beautiful constellation Vi[s']ákhá pines
to be united with the Moon[53]?

ANASÚYÁ.

By what stratagem can we best secure to our friend the
accomplishment of her heart's desire both speedily and secretly?

PRIYAMVADÁ.

The latter point is all we have to think about. As to 'speedily,'
I look upon the whole affair as already settled.

ANASÚYÁ.

How so?

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Did you not observe how the King betrayed his liking by the
tender manner in which he gazed upon her, and how thin he has
become the last few days, as if he had been lying awake thinking
of her?

KING.                                      [_Looking at himself_.

Quite true! I certainly am becoming thin from want of sleep:

  As night by night in anxious thought I raise
  This wasted arm to rest my sleepless head,
  My jewelled bracelet, sullied by the tears
  That trickle from my eyes in scalding streams,
  Slips towards my elbow from my shrivelled wrist.
  Oft I replace the bauble, but in vain;
  So easily it spans the fleshless limb
  That e'en the rough and corrugated skin,
  Scarred by the bow-string, will not check its fall[54].

PRIYAMVADÁ.

An idea strikes me, Anasúyá. Let [S']akoontalá write a love-letter;
I will conceal it in a flower, and contrive to drop it in the
King's path. He will surely mistake it for the remains of some
sacred offering, and will, in all probability, pick it up.

ANASÚYÁ.

A very ingenious device! It my entire approval; but what says
[S']akoontalá?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

I must consider before I can consent to it.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Could, you not, dear [S']akoontalá, think of some pretty
composition in verse, containing a delicate declaration of your
love?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Well, I will do my best; but my heart trembles when I think of
the chances of a refusal.

KING.                                            [_With rapture_.

  Too timid maid, here stands the man from whom
  Thou fearest a repulse; supremely blessed
  To call thee all his own. Well might he doubt
  His title to thy love; but how could'st thou
  Believe thy beauty powerless to subdue him?

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

You undervalue your own merits, dear [S']akoontalá. What man in his
senses would intercept with the skirt of his robe the bright rays
of the autumnal moon, which alone can allay the fever of his
body?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                           [_Smiling_.

Then it seems I must do as I am bid.

                         [_Sits down and appears to be thinking_.

KING.

How charming she looks! My very eyes forget to wink, jealous of
losing even for an instant a sight so enchanting.

  How beautiful the movement of her brow,
  As through her mind love's tender fancies flow!
  And, as she weighs her thoughts, how sweet to trace
  The ardent passion mantling in her face!

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Dear girls, I have thought of a verse, but I have no
writing-materials at hand.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Write the letters with your nail on this lotus-leaf, which is
smooth as a parrot's breast.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                          [_After writing the verse_.

Listen, dear friends, and tell me whether the ideas are
appropriately expressed.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

We are all attention.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                             [_Reads_.

  I know not the secret thy bosom conceals,
  Thy form is not near me to gladden my sight;
  But sad is the tale that my fever reveals,
  Of the love that consumes me by day and by night.

KING.                           [_Advancing hastily towards her_.

  Nay, Love does but warm thee, fair maiden,--thy frame
  Only droops like the bud in the glare of the noon;
  But me he consumes with a pitiless flame,
  As the beams of the day-star destroy the pale moon.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

             [_Looking at him joyfully and rising to salute him_.

Welcome, the desire of our hearts, that so speedily presents
itself!

                          [[S']AKOONTALÁ _makes an effort to rise_.

KING.

Nay, trouble not thyself, dear maiden.

  Move not to do me homage; let thy limbs
  Still softly rest upon their flowery couch;
  And gather fragrance from the lotus-stalks,
  Bruised by the fevered contact of thy frame.

ANASÚYÁ.

Deign, gentle Sir, to seat yourself on the rock on which our
friend is reposing.

              [_The_ KING _sits down_. [S']AKOONTALÁ _is confused_.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Any one may see at a glance that you are deeply attached to each
other. But the affection I have for my friend prompts me to say
something of which you hardly require to be informed.

KING.

Do not hesitate to speak out, my good girl. If you omit to say
what is in your mind, you may be sorry for it afterwards.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Is it not your special office as a King to remove the suffering
of your subjects who are in trouble?

KING.

Such is my duty, most assuredly.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Know, then, that our dear friend has been brought to her present
state of suffering entirely through love for you. Her life is in
your hands; take pity on her and restore her to health.

KING.

Excellent maiden, our attachment is mutual. It is I who am the
most honoured by it.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                            [_Looking at PRIYAMVADÁ_.

What do you mean by detaining the King, who must be anxious to
return to his royal consorts after so long a separation?

KING.

  Sweet maiden, banish from thy mind the thought
  That I could love another. Thou dost reign
  Supreme, without a rival, in my heart,
  And I am thine alone; disown me not,
  Else must I die a second deadlier death,
  Killed by thy words, as erst by Káma's[47] shafts.

ANASÚYÁ.

Kind Sir, we have heard it said that kings have many favourite
consorts. You must not, then, by your behaviour towards our dear
friend, give her relations cause to sorrow for her.

KING.

Listen, gentle maiden, while in a few words I quiet your anxiety.

  Though many beauteous forms my palace grace,
  Henceforth two things alone will I esteem
  The glory of my royal dynasty--
  My sea-girt realm, and this most lovely maid.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

We are satisfied by your assurances.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                              [_Glancing on one side_.

See, Anasúyá, there is our favourite little fawn running about in
great distress, and turning its eyes in every direction as if
looking for its mother; come, let us help the little thing to
find her. [_Both move away_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Dear friends, dear friends, leave me not alone and unprotected.
Why need you both go?

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

Unprotected! when the Protector of the world is at your side.

                                                       [_Exeunt_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

What! have they both really left me?

KING.

Distress not thyself, sweet maiden. Thy adorer is at hand to wait
upon thee.

  Oh let me tend thee, fair one, in the place
  Of thy dear friends; and with broad lotus fans
  Raise cooling breezes to refresh thy frame;
  Or shall I rather, with caressing touch,
  Allay the fever of thy limbs, and soothe
  Thy aching feet, beauteous as blushing lilies?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Nay, touch me not. I will not incur the censure of those whom I
am bound to respect.

                                     [_Rises and attempts to go_.

KING.

Fair one, the heat of noon has not yet subsided, and thy body is
still feeble.

  How canst thou quit thy fragrant couch of flowers,
  And from thy throbbing bosom cast aside
  Its covering of lotus-leaves, to brave
  With weak and fainting limbs the noon-day heat?

                                      [_Forces her to turn back_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Infringe not the rules of decorum, mighty descendant of Puru.
Remember, though I love you, I have no power to dispose of
myself.

KING.

Why this fear of offending your relations, timid maid? When your
venerable foster-father hears of it, he will not find fault with
you. He knows that the law permits us to be united without
consulting him.

  In Indra's heaven, so at least 'tis said,
  No nuptial rites prevail[55], nor is the bride
  Led to the altar by her future lord;
  But all in secret does the bridegroom plight
  His troth, and each unto the other vow
  Mutual allegiance. Such espousals, too,
  Are authorised on earth, and many daughters
  Of royal saints thus wedded to their lords
  Have still received their father's benison.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Leave me, leave me; I must take counsel with my female friends.

KING.

I will leave thee when--

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

When?

KING.

  When I have gently stolen from thy lips
  Their yet untasted nectar, to allay
  The raging of my thirst, e'en as the bee
  Sips the fresh honey from the opening bud.

             [_Attempts to raise her face_.  [S']AKOONTALÁ tries to
                                                    prevent him_.

A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

The loving birds, doomed by fate to nightly separation[56], must
bid farewell to each other, for evening is at hand.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                    [_In confusion_.

Great Prince, I hear the voice of the matron Gautamí. She is
coming this way to inquire after my health. Hasten and conceal
yourself behind the branches.

KING.

I will.                                      [_Conceals himself_.

_Enter_ GAUTAMÍ _with a vase in her hand, preceded by two
attendants_.

ATTENDANTS.

This way, most venerable Gautamí.

GAUTAMÍ.                               [_Approaching_ [S']AKOONTALÁ.

My child, is the fever of thy limbs allayed?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Venerable mother, there is certainly a change for the better.

GAUTAMÍ.

Let me sprinkle you with this holy water, and all
your ailments will depart.

[_Sprinkling_ [S']AKOONTALÁ on the head_.]

The day is closing, my child; come, let us go to the cottage.

                                           [_They all move away_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                             [_Aside_.

Oh my heart! thou didst fear to taste of happiness when it was
within thy reach. Now that the object of thy desires is torn from
thee, how bitter will be thy remorse, how distracting thine
anguish!

[_Moving on a few steps and stopping. Aloud_.]

Farewell! bower of creepers, sweet soother of my sufferings,
farewell! may I soon again be happy under thy shade.

                             [_Exit reluctantly with the others_.

KING.

          [_Returning to his former seat in the arbour. Sighing_.

Alas! how many are the obstacles to the accomplishment of our
wishes!

  Albeit she did coyly turn away
  Her glowing cheek, and with her fingers guard
  Her pouting lips, that murmured a denial
  In faltering accents, she did yield herself
  A sweet reluctant captive to my will.
  As eagerly I raised her lovely face;
  But ere with gentle force I stole the kiss,
  Too envious Fate did mar my daring purpose.

Whither now shall I betake myself? I will tarry for a brief space
in this bower of creepers, so endeared to me by the presence of
my beloved [S']akoontalá.

                                                [_Looking round_.

  Here printed on the flowery couch I see
  The fair impression of her slender limbs;
  Here is the sweet confession of her love,
  Traced with her nail upon the lotus-leaf;
  And yonder are the withered lily-stalks
  That graced her wrist. While all around I view
  Things that recall her image, can I quit
  This bower, e'en though its living be fled?

A VOICE IN THE AIR.

Great King,

  Scarce is our evening sacrifice begun,
  When evil demons, lurid as the clouds
  That gather round the dying orb of day,
  Cluster in hideous troops, obscene and dread,
  About our altars, casting far and near
  Terrific shadows, while the sacred fire
  Sheds a pale lustre o'er their ghostly shapes.

KING.

I come to the rescue, I come.

                                                         [_Exit_.

       *       *       *       *       *




PRELUDE TO ACT IV.


SCENE.--_The Garden of the Hermitage_.

_Enter_ PRIYAMVADÁ and ANASÚYÁ in the act of gathering flowers_.

ANASÚYÁ.

Although, dear Priyamvadá, it rejoices my heart to think that
[S']akoontalá has been happily united to a husband in every respect
worthy of her, by the form of marriage prevalent among Indra's
celestial musicians, nevertheless, I cannot help feeling somewhat
uneasy in my mind.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

How so?

ANASÚYÁ.

You know that the pious King was gratefully dismissed by the
hermits on the successful termination of their sacrificial rites.
He has now returned to his capital, leaving [S']akoontalá under our
care; and it may be doubted whether, in the society of his royal
consorts, he will not forget all that has taken place in this
hermitage of ours.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

On that score be at ease. Persons of his noble nature are not so
destitute of all honourable feeling. I confess, however, that
there is one point about which I am rather anxious. What, think
you, will Father Kanwa say when he hears what has occurred?

ANASÚYÁ.

In my opinion, he will approve the marriage.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

What makes you think so?

ANASÚYÁ.

From the first, it was always his fixed purpose to bestow the
maiden on a husband worthy of her; and since heaven has given her
such a husband, his wishes have been realized without any trouble
to himself.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                      [_Looking at the flower-basket_.

We have gathered flowers enough for the sacred offering, dear
Anasúyá.

ANASÚYÁ.

Well, then, let us now gather more, that we may have wherewith to
propitiate the guardian-deity of our dear [S']akoontalá.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

By all means.

                                      [_They continue gathering_.

A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

Ho there! See you not that I am here!

ANASÚYÁ.

That must be the voice of a guest announcing his arrival.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Surely, [S']akoontalá is not absent from the cottage.

[_Aside_.]

Her heart at least is absent, I fear.

ANASÚYÁ.

Come along, come along; we have gathered flowers
enough.

                                               [_They move away_.

THE SAME VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

Woe to thee, maiden, for daring to slight a guest like me!

  Shall I stand here unwelcomed--even I,
  A very mine of penitential merit,
  Worthy of all respect? Shalt thou, rash maid,
  Thus set at nought the ever sacred ties
  Of hospitality? and fix thy thoughts
  Upon the cherished object of thy love,
  While I am present? Thus I curse thee, then--
  He, even he of whom thou thinkest, he
  Shall think no more of thee; nor in his heart
  Retain thine image. Vainly shalt thou strive
  To waken his remembrance of the past;
  He shall disown thee, even as the sot,
  Roused from his midnight drunkenness, denies
  The words he uttered in his revellings.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Alas! alas! I fear a terrible misfortune has occurred.
[S']akoontalá, from absence of mind, must have offended some guest
whom she was bound to treat with respect.

[_Looking behind the scenes_.]

Ah! yes; I see; and no less a person than the great sage
Durvásas[57], who is known to be most irascible. He it is that
has just cursed her, and is now retiring with hasty strides,
trembling with passion, and looking as if nothing could turn him.
His wrath is like a consuming fire.

ANASÚYÁ.

Go quickly, dear Priyamvadá, throw yourself at his feet, and
persuade him to come back, while I prepare a propitiatory
offering[59] for him, with water and refreshments.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

I will.

                                                         [_Exit_.

ANASÚYÁ.

[_Advancing hastily a few steps and stumbling_.

Alas! alas! this comes of being in a hurry. My foot has slipped,
and my basket of flowers has fallen from my hand.

                                      [_Stays to gather them up_.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                               [_Re-entering_

Well, dear Anasúyá, I have done my best; but what living being
could succeed in pacifying such a cross-grained, ill-tempered old
fellow? However, I managed to mollify him a little.

ANASÚYÁ                                               [_Smiling_.

Even a little was much for him. Say on.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

When he refused to turn back, I implored his forgiveness in these
words: 'Most venerable sage, pardon, I beseech you, this first
offence of a young and inexperienced girl, who was ignorant of
the respect due to your saintly character and exalted rank.'

ANASÚYÁ

And what did he reply?

PRIYAMVADÁ.

'My word must not be falsified; but, at the sight of the ring of
recognition the spell shall cease.' So saying, he disappeared.

ANASÚYÁ.

Oh! then we may breathe again; for, now I think of it, the King
himself, at his departure, fastened on [S']akoontalá's finger, as a
token of remembrance, a ring on which his own name was engraved.
She has, therefore, a remedy for her misfortune at her own
command.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Come, dear Anasúyá, let us proceed with our religious duties.

                                              [_They walk round_.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                             [_Looking off the stage_.

See, Anasúyá, there sits our dear friend, motionless as a statue,
resting her face on her left hand, her whole mind absorbed in
thinking of her absent husband. She can pay no attention to
herself, much less to a stranger.

ANASÚYÁ.

Priyamvadá, let this affair never pass our lips. We must spare
our dear friend's feelings. Her constitution is too delicate to
bear much emotion.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

I agree with you. Who would think of watering a tender jasmine
with hot water?



ACT IV.

Scene.--_The Neighbourhood of the Hermitage.

Enter one of_ Kanwa's Pupils _just arisen from his couch at the
dawn of day_.

PUPIL.

My master, the venerable Kanwa, who is but lately returned from
his pilgrimage, has ordered me to ascertain how the time goes. I
have therefore come into the open air to see if it be still dark.

 [_Walking and looking about_.]

Oh! the dawn has already broken.

  Lo! in one quarter of the sky, the Moon,
  Lord of the herbs and night-expanding flowers,
  Sinks towards his bed behind the western hills;
  While in the east, preceded by the Dawn,
  His blushing charioteer[59], the glorious Sun
  Begins his course, and far into the gloom
  Casts the first radiance of his orient beams.
  Hail! co-eternal orbs, that rise to set,
  And set to rise again; symbols divine
  Of man's reverses, life's vicissitudes.

And now,

  While the round Moon withdraws his looming disc
  Beneath the western sky, the full-blown flower
  Of the night-loving lotus[60] sheds her leave
  In sorrow for his loss, bequeathing nought
  But the sweet memory of her loveliness
  To my bereaved sight; e'en as the bride
  Disconsolately mourns her absent lord,
  And yields her heart a prey to anxious grief.

ANASÚYÁ.                                    [_Entering abruptly_.

Little as I know of the ways of the world, I cannot help thinking
that King Dushyanta is treating [S']akoontalá very improperly.

PUPIL.

Well, I must let my revered preceptor know that it is time to
offer the burnt oblation.

                                                         [_Exit_.

ANASÚYÁ.

I am broad awake, but what shall I do? I have no energy to go
about my usual occupations. My hands and feet seem to have lost
their power. Well, Love has gained his object; and Love only is
to blame for having induced our dear friend, in the innocence of
her heart, to confide in such a perfidious man. Possibly,
however, the imprecation of Durvásas may he already taking
effect. Indeed, I cannot otherwise account for the King's strange
conduct, in allowing so long a time to elapse without even a
letter; and that, too, after so many promises and protestations.
I cannot think what to do unless we send him the ring which was
to be the token of recognition. But which of these austere
hermits could we ask to be the bearer of it? Then, again, Father
Kanwa has just returned from his pilgrimage; and how am I to
inform him of [S']akoontalá's marriage to King Dushyanta, and her
expectation of becoming soon a mother? I never could bring myself
to tell him, even if I felt that [S']akoontalá had been in fault,
which she certainly has not. What is to be done?

PRIYAMVADÁ.                                [_Entering;  joyfully_.

Quick! quick! Anasúyá! come and assist in the joyful preparations
for [S']akoontalá's departure to her husband's palace.

ANASÚYÁ.

My dear girl, what can you mean?

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Listen, now, and I will tell you all about it. I went just now to
[S']akoontalá, to inquire whether she had slept comfortably--

ANASÚYÁ.

Well, well; go on.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

She was sitting with her face bowed down to the very ground with
shame, when Father Kanwa entered, and, embracing her, of his own
accord offered her his congratulations. 'I give thee joy, my
child,' he said, 'we have had an auspicious omen. The priest who
offered the oblation dropped it into the very centre of the
sacred fire [81], though thick smoke obstructed his vision.
Henceforth thou wilt cease to be an object of compassion. This
very day I purpose sending thee, under the charge of certain
trusty hermits, to the King's palace; and shall deliver thee into
the hands of thy husband, as I would commit knowledge to the
keeping of a wise and faithful student.'

ANASÚYÁ.

Who, then, informed the holy father of what passed in his
absence?

PRIYAMVADÁ.

As he was entering the sanctuary of the consecrated fire, an
invisible being chanted a verse in celestial strains.

ANASÚYÁ.                                    [_With astonishment_.

Indeed! pray repeat it.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                               [_Repeating the verse_.

  Glows in thy daughter King Dushyanta's glory,
  As in the sacred tree the mystic fire [62];
  Let worlds rejoice to hear the welcome story,
  And may the son immortalize the sire.

ANASÚYÁ.                                 [_Embracing_ PRIYAMVADÁ.

Oh, my dear Priyamvadá, what delightful news! I am pleased
beyond measure; yet when I think that we are to lose our dear
[S']akoontalá this very day, a feeling of melancholy mingles with
my joy.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

We shall find means of consoling ourselves after her departure.
Let the dear creature only be made happy at any cost.

ANASÚYÁ.

Yes, yes, Priyamvadá, it shall be so; and now to prepare the
bridal array. I have always looked forward to this occasion, and
some time since, I deposited a beautiful garland of Ke[S']ara
flowers in a cocoa-nut box, and suspended it on a bough of
yonder mango-tree. Be good enough to stretch out your hand and
take it down, while I compound unguents and perfumes with this
consecrated paste and these blades of sacred grass.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Very well.

           [_Exit_ ANASÚYÁ. PRIYAMVADÁ  _takes down the flowers_.

A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

Gautamí, bid [S']árngarava and the others hold themselves in
readiness to escort [S']akoontalá.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                                         [_Listening_.

Quick, quick, Anasúyá! They are calling the
hermits who are to go with [S']akoontalá to Hastinápur[83].

ANASÚYÁ. [_Re-entering with the perfumed unguents in her
hand_.

Come along then, Priyamvadá; I am ready to go with you.

                                               [_They walk away_.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                                           [_Looking_.

See! there sits [S']akoontalá, her locks arranged even at this
early hour of the morning. The holy women of the hermitage are
congratulating her, and invoking blessings on her head, while
they present her with wedding-gifts and offerings of consecrated
wild-rice. Let us join them.

                                               [_They approach_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ _is seen seated, with women surrounding her, occupied
in the manner described_.

FIRST WOMAN.                                  [_To_ [S']AKOONTALÁ.

My child, may'st thou receive the title of 'Chief-queen,' and may
thy husband delight to honour thee above all others!

SECOND WOMAN.

My child, may'st thou be the mother of a hero!

THIRD WOMAN.

My child, may'st thou be highly honoured by thy lord!

[_Exeunt all the women, excepting_ GAUTAMÍ, after blessing_
[S']AKOONTALÁ.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.                           [_Approaching_.

Dear [S']akoontalá, we are come to assist you at your toilet, and
may a blessing attend it!

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Welcome, dear friends, welcome. Sit down here.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

      [_Taking the baskets containing the bridal decorations, and
                                                   sitting down_.

Now, then, dearest, prepare to let us dress you. We must first
rub your limbs with these perfumed unguents.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

I ought indeed to be grateful for your kind offices, now that I
am so soon to be deprived of them. Dear, dear friends, perhaps I
shall never be dressed by you again.

                                            [_Bursts into tears_.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

Weep not, dearest; tears are out of season on such a happy
occasion.

              [_They wipe away her tears and begin to dress her_.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

Alas! these simple flowers and rude ornaments, which our
hermitage offers in abundance, do not set off your beauty as it
deserves.

_Enter TWO YOUNG HERMITS, bearing costly presents_.

BOTH HERMITS.

Here are ornaments suitable for a queen.

[_The women look at them in astonishment_.

GAUTAMÍ

Why, Nárada, my son, whence came these?

FIRST HERMIT.

You owe them to the devotion of Father Kanwa.

GAUTAMÍ.

Did he create them by the power of his own mind?

SECOND HERMIT.

Certainly not; but you shall hear. The venerable sage ordered us
to collect flowers for [S']akoontalá from the forest-trees; and we
went to the wood for that purpose, when

  Straightway depending from a neighbouring tree
  Appeared a robe of linen tissue, pure
  And spotless as a moonbeam--mystic pledge
  Of bridal happiness; another tree
  Distilled a roseate dye wherewith to stain
  The lady's feet [135]; and other branches near
  Glistened with rare and costly ornaments.
  While, 'mid the leaves, the hands of forest-nymphs,
  Vying in beauty with the opening buds,
  Presented us with sylvan offerings.

PRIYAMVADÁ.                            [_Looking at_ [S']AKOONTALÁ.

The wood-nymphs have done you honour, indeed. This favour
doubtless signifies that you are soon to be received as a happy
wife into your husband's house, and are from this time forward to
become the partner of his royal fortunes.

[[S']AKOONTALÁ _appears abashed_.

FIRST HERMIT.

Come, Gautama; Father Kanwa has finished his ablutions. Let us go
and inform him of the favour we have received from the deities
who preside over our trees.

SECOND HERMIT.

By all means.

                                                       [_Exeunt_.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ

Alas! what are we to do? We are unused to such splendid
decorations, and are at a loss how to arrange them. Our
knowledge of painting must be our guide. We will dispose the
ornaments as we have seen them in pictures.

[S']AKOONTALÁ

Whatever pleases you, dear girls, will please me. I have perfect
confidence In your taste.

                                   [_They commence dressing her_.

_Enter_ KANWA, _having just finished his ablutions_.

KANWA.

  This day my loved one leaves me, and my heart
  Is heavy with its grief; the streams of sorrow,
  Choked at the source, repress my faltering voice,
  I have no words to speak; mine eyes are dimmed
  By the dark shadows of the thoughts that rise
  Within my soul. If such the force of grief
  In an old hermit parted from his nursling,
  What anguish must the stricken parent feel--
  Bereft for ever of an only daughter.

[_Advances towards_ [S']AKOONTALÁ

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

Now, dearest [S']akoontalá, we have finished decorating you. You
have only to put on the two linen mantles.

                            [[S']AKOONTALÁ _rises and puts them on_.

GAUTAMÍ.

Daughter, see, here comes thy foster-father; he is eager to fold
thee in his arms; his eyes swim with tears of joy. Hasten to do
him reverence.

[S']AKOONTALÁ                                        [_Reverently_.

My father, I salute you.

KANWA.

My daughter,

  May'st thou be highly honoured by thy lord,
  E'en as Yayáti [S']armishthá adored[64]!
  And, as she bore him Puru, so may'st thou
  Bring forth a son to whom the world shall bow!

GAUTAMÍ.

Most venerable father, she accepts your benediction as if she
already possessed the boon it confers.

KANWA.

Now come this way, my child, and walk reverently
round these sacrificial fires.

                                          [_They all walk round_.

KANWA.

                [_Repeats a prayer in the metre of the Rig-veda_.

  Holy flames, that gleam around
  Every altar's hallowed ground;
  Holy flames, whose frequent food
  Is the consecrated wood,
  And for whose encircling bed,
  Sacred Ku[s']a-grass is spread [65];
  Holy flames, that waft to heaven
  Sweet oblations daily given,
  Mortal guilt to purge away,
  Hear, oh hear me, when I pray--
  Purify my child this day!

Now then, my daughter, set out on thy journey.

[_Looking on one side_.]

Where are thy attendants. [S']árngarava and the others?

YOUNG HERMIT.                                        [_Entering_.

Here we are, most venerable father.

KANWA.

Lead the way for thy sister.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Come, [S']akoontalá, let us proceed.

                                                [_All move away_.

KANWA.

  Hear me, ye trees that surround our hermitage!
  [S']akoontalá ne'er moistened in the stream
  Her own parched lips, till she had fondly poured
  Its purest water on your thirsty roots;
  And oft, when she would fain have decked her hair
  With your thick-clustering blossoms, in her love
  She robbed you not e'en of a single flower.
  Her highest joy was ever to behold
  The early glory of your opening buds;
  Oh, then, dismiss her with a kind farewell.
  This very day she quits her father's home,
  To seek the palace of her wedded lord.

[_The note of a Koïl[66] is heard_.

  Hark! heard'st thou not the answer of the trees,
  Our sylvan sisters, warbled in the note
  Of the melodious Koïl[66]? they dismiss
  Their dear [S']akoontalá with loving wishes.

VOICES IN THE AIR.

  Fare thee well, journey pleasantly on amid streams
  Where the lotuses bloom, and the sun's glowing beams
  Never pierce the deep shade of the wide-spreading trees,
  While gently around thee shall sport the cool breeze;
  Then light be thy footsteps and easy thy tread,
  Beneath thee shall carpets of lilies be spread;
  Journey on to thy lord, let thy spirit be gay,
  For the smiles of all Nature shall gladden thy way.

                                 [_All listen with astonishment_.

GAUTAMÍ.

Daughter! the nymphs of the wood, who love thee with the
affection of a sister, dismiss thee with kind wishes for thy
happiness. Take thou leave of them reverentially.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

[_Bowing respectfully and walking on. Aside to her friend_.

Eager as I am, dear Priyamvadá, to see my husband once more, yet
my feet refuse to move, now that I am quitting for ever the home
of my girlhood.

PRIYAMVADÁ.

You are not the only one, dearest, to feel the bitterness of
parting. As the time of separation approaches, the whole grove
seems to share your anguish.

  In sorrow for thy loss, the herd of deer
  Forget to browse; the peacock on the lawn
  Ceases its dance[67]; the very trees around
  Shed their pale leaves, like tears, upon the ground.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                             [_Recollecting herself_.

My father, let me, before I go, bid adieu to my pet jasmine, the
Moonlight of the Grove[68]. I love the plant almost as a sister.

KANWA.

Yes, yes, my child, I remember thy sisterly affection for the
creeper. Here it is on the right.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                          [_Approaching the jasmine_.

My beloved jasmine! most brilliant of climbing plants, how sweet
it is to see thee cling thus fondly to thy husband, the
mango-tree; yet, prithee, turn thy twining arms for a moment in
this direction to embrace thy sister; she is going far away, and
may never see thee again.

KANWA.

  Daughter, the cherished purpose of my heart
  Has ever been to wed thee to a man
  That should be worthy of thee; such a spouse
  Hast thou thyself, by thine own merits, won.
  To him thou goest, and about his neck
  Soon shalt thou cling confidingly, as now
  Thy favourite jasmine twines its loving arms
  Around the sturdy mango. Leave thou it
  To its protector--e'en as I consign
  Thee to thy lord, and henceforth from my mind
  Banish all anxious thought on thy behalf.

Proceed on thy journey, my child.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                      [_To_ PRIYAMVADÁ _and_ ANASÚYÁ.

To you, my sweet companions, I leave it as a keepsake. Take
charge of it when I am gone.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.                   [_Bursting into tears_.

And to whose charge do you leave us, dearest? Who will care for
us when you are gone?

KANWA.

For shame, Anasúyá! dry your tears. Is this the way to cheer your
friend at a time when she needs your support and consolation?

                                                  [_All move on_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

My father, see you there my pet deer, grazing close to the
hermitage? She expects soon to fawn, and even now the weight of
the little one she carries hinders her movements. Do not forget
to send me word when she becomes a mother.

KANWA.

I will not forget it.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                       [_Feeling herself drawn back_.

What can this be, fastened to my dress?

                                                  [_Turns round_.

KANWA.

My daughter,

  It is the little fawn, thy foster-child,
  Poor helpless orphan! it remembers well
  How with a mother's tenderness and love
  Thou didst protect it, and with grains of rice
  From thine own hand didst daily nourish it;
  And, ever and anon, when some sharp thorn
  Had pierced its mouth, how gently thou didst tend
  The bleeding wound, and pour in healing balm.
  The grateful nursling clings to its protectress,
  Mutely imploring leave to follow her.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

My poor little fawn! dost thou ask to follow an ungrateful
wretch who hesitates not to desert her companions! When thy
mother died, soon after thy birth, I supplied her place, and
reared thee with my own hand; and now that thy second mother is
about to leave thee, who will care for thee? My father, be thou a
mother to her. My child, go back, and be a daughter to my father.

                                            [_Moves on, weeping_.

KANWA.

  Weep not, my daughter, check the gathering tear
  That lurks beneath thine eyelid, ere it flow
  And weaken thy resolve; be firm and true--
  True to thyself and me; the path of life
  Will lead o'er hill and plain, o'er rough and smooth,
  And all must feel the steepness of the way;
  Though rugged be thy course, press boldly on.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Venerable Sire! the sacred precept is:--'Accompany thy friend as
far as the margin of the first stream.' Here, then, we are
arrived at the border of a lake. It is time for you to give us
your final instructions and return.

KANWA.

Be it so; let us tarry for a moment under the shade of this
fig-tree[69].

[_They do so_.

KANWA                                                   [_Aside_.

I must think of some appropriate message to send to his Majesty
King Dushyanta.

[_Reflects_. .

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                 [_Aside to_ ANASÚYÁ.

See, see, dear Anasúyá, the poor female Chakraváka-bird[70], whom
cruel fate dooms to nightly separation from her mate, calls to
him in mournful notes from the other side of the stream, though
he is only hidden from her view by the spreading leaves of the
water-lily. Her cry is so piteous that I could almost fancy she
was lamenting her hard lot in intelligible words.

ANASÚYÁ

Say not so, dearest:

  Fond bird! though sorrow lengthen out her night
  Of widowhood, yet with a cry of joy
  She hails the morning light that brings her mate
  Back to her side. The agony of parting
  Would wound us like a sword, but that its edge
  Is blunted by the hope of future meeting.

KANWA.

[S']árngarava! when you have introduced [S']akoontalá into the
presence of the King, you must give him this message from me:--

[S']ÁRNGARAVA

Let me hear it, venerable father.

KANWA.

This is it:--

  Most puissant prince! we here present before thee
  One thou art bound to cherish and receive
  As thine own wife; yea, even to enthrone
  As thine own queen--worthy of equal love
  With thine imperial consorts. So much, Sire,
  We claim of thee as justice due to us,
  In virtue of our holy character,
  In virtue of thine honourable rank,
  In virtue of the pure spontaneous love
  That secretly grew up 'twixt thee and her,
  Without consent or privity of us.
  We ask no more--the rest we freely leave
  To thy just feeling and to destiny.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

A most suitable message! I will take care to deliver it
correctly.

KANWA.

And, now, my child, a few words of advice for thee. We hermits,
though we live secluded from the world are not ignorant of
worldly matters.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

No, indeed. Wise men are conversant with all subjects.

KANWA.

Listen, then, my daughter. When thou reachest thy husband's
palace, and art admitted into his family,

  Honour thy betters; ever be respectful
  To those above thee; and, should others share
  Thy husband's love, ne'er yield thyself a prey
  to jealousy; but ever be a friend,
  A loving friend, to those who rival thee
  In his affections. Should thy wedded lord
  Treat thee with harshness, thou most never be
  Harsh in return, but patient and submissive;
  Be to thy menials courteous, and to all
  Placed under thee, considerate and kind;
  Be never self-indulgent, but avoid
  Excess in pleasure; and, when fortune smiles,
  Be not puffed up. Thus to thy husband's house
  Wilt thou a blessing prove, and not a curse.

What thinks Gautamí of this advice?

GAUTAMÍ.

An excellent compendium, truly, of every wife's duties! Lay it
well to heart, my daughter.

KANWA.

Come, my beloved child, one parting embrace for me and for thy
companions, and then we leave thee.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

My father, must Priyamvadá and Anasúyá really return with you?
They are very dear to me.

KANWA.

Yes, my child; they, too, in good time, will be given in marriage
to suitable husbands. It would not be proper for them to
accompany thee to such a public place. But Gautamí shall be thy
companion.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                    [_Embracing him_.

Removed from thy bosom, my beloved father, like a young
tendril of the sandal-tree torn from its home in the western
mountains[71], how shall I be able to support life in a foreign
soil?

KANWA.

Daughter, thy fears are groundless.

  Soon shall thy lord prefer thee to the rank
  Of his own consort; and unnumbered cares
  Befitting his imperial dignity
  Shall constantly engross thee. Then the bliss
  Of bearing him a son--a noble boy,
  Bright as the day-star, shall transport thy soul
  With new delights, and little shalt thou reck
  Of the light sorrow that afflicts thee now
  At parting from thy father and thy friends.

       [[S']AKOONTALÁ _throws herself at her foster-father's feet_.

KANWA.

Blessings on thee, my child! May all my hopes of thee be
realized!

[S']AKOONTALÁ                           [_Approaching her friends_.

Come, my two loved companions, embrace me both of you together.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.                         [_Embracing her_.

Dear [S']akoontalá, remember, if the King should by any chance be
slow in recognizing you, you have only to show him this ring, on
which his own name is engraved.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

The bare thought of it puts me in a tremor.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

There is no real cause for fear, dearest. Excessive affection is
too apt to suspect evil where none exists.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Come, lady, we must hasten on. The sun is rising in the heavens.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                    [_Looking towards the hermitage_.

Dear father, when shall I ever see this hallowed grove again?

KANWA.

I will tell thee; listen:--

  When thou hast passed a long and blissful life
  As King Dushyanta's queen, and jointly shared
  With all the earth his ever-watchful care;
  And hast beheld thine own heroic son,
  Matchless in arms, united to a bride
  In happy wedlock; when his aged sire,
  Thy faithful husband, hath to him resigned
  The helm of state; then, weary of the world,
  Together with Dushyanta thou shalt seek
  The calm seclusion of thy former home[72];
  There amid holy scenes to be at peace,
  Till thy pure spirit gain its last release.

GAUTAMÍ.

Come, my child, the favourable time for our journey is fast
passing. Let thy father return. Venerable Sire, be thou the first
to move homewards, or these last words will never end.

KANWA.

Daughter, detain me no longer. My religious duties must not be
interrupted.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                [_Again embracing her foster-father_.

Beloved father, thy frame is much enfeebled by penitential
exercises. Do not, oh! do not, allow thyself to sorrow too much
on my account.

KANWA.                                                [_Sighing_.

  How, O my child, shall my bereaved heart
  Forget its bitterness, when, day by day,
  Full in my sight shall grow the tender plants
  Reared by thy care, or sprang from hallowed grain
  Which thy loved hands have strewn around the door--
  A frequent offering to our household gods[73]?

Go, my daughter, and may thy journey be prosperous.

                           [_Exit_ [S']AKOONTALÁ _with her escort_.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.              [_Gazing after_ [S']AKOONTALÁ.

Alas! alas! she is gone, and now the trees hide our darling from
our view.

KANWA.                                                [_Sighing_.

Well, Anasúyá, your sister has departed. Moderate your grief,
both of you, and follow me, I go back to the hermitage.

PRIYAMVADÁ AND ANASÚYÁ.

Holy father, the sacred grove will be a desert without
[S']akoontalá. How can we ever return to it?

KANWA.

It is natural enough that your affection should make you view it
in this light.

[_Walking pensively on_.]

As for me, I am quite surprised at myself. Now that I have fairly
dismissed her to her husband's house, my mind is easy; for,
indeed,

  A daughter is a loan--a precious jewel
  Lent to a parent till her husband claim her.
  And now that to her rightful lord and master
  I have delivered her, my burdened soul
  Is lightened, and I seem to breathe more freely.

                                                       [_Exeunt_.

       *       *       *       *       *




ACT V.

SCENE.--_A Room in the Palace_.

_The King_ DUSHYANTA _and the Jester_ MÁ[T.]HAVYA _are discovered
seated_.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.                                          [_Listening_.

Hark! my dear friend, listen a minute, and you will hear sweet
sounds proceeding from the music-room. Some one is singing a
charming air. Who can it be? Oh! I know. The queen Hansapadiká is
practising her notes, that she may greet you with a new song.

KING.

Hush! Let me listen.

A VOICE SINGS BEHIND THE SCENES.

  How often hither didst thou rove,
  Sweet bee, to kiss the mango's cheek;
  Oh! leave not, then, thy early love,
  The lily's honeyed lip to seek.

KING.

A most impassioned strain, truly!

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Do you understand the meaning of the words?

KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.

She means to reprove me, because I once paid her great attention,
and have lately deserted her for the queen Vasumatí. Go, my dear
fellow, and tell Hansapadiká from me that I take her delicate
reproof as it is intended.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Very well.

[_Rising from his seat_.]

But stay--I don't much relish being sent to bear the brunt of her
jealousy. The chances are that she will have me seized by the
hair of the head and beaten to a jelly. I would as soon expose
myself, after a vow of celibacy, to the seductions of a lovely
nymph, as encounter the fury of a jealous woman.

KING.

Go, go; you can disarm her wrath by a civil speech; but give her
my message.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

What must be must be, I suppose.

                                                         [_Exit_.

KING.                                                   [_Aside_.

Strange! that song has filled me with a most peculiar sensation.
A melancholy feeling has come over me, and I seem to yearn after
some long-forgotten object of affection. Singular, indeed! but

  Not seldom In our happy hours of ease,
  When thought is still, the sight of some fair form,
  Or mournful fall of music breathing low,
  Will stir strange fancies, thrilling all the soul
  With a mysterious sadness, and a sense
  Of vague yet earnest longing. Can it be
  That the dim memory of events long past,
  Or friendships formed in other states of being[74],
  Flits like a passing shadow o'er the spirit?

                                      [_Remains pensive and sad_.

_Enter the_ CHAMBERLAIN[75], _named_ VÁTÁYANA.

CHAMBERLAIN.

Alas! to what an advanced period of life have I attained!

  Even this wand betrays the lapse of years;
  In youthful days 'twas but a useless badge
  And symbol of my office; now it serves
  As a support to prop my tottering steps.

Ah me! I feel very unwilling to announce to the King that a
deputation of young hermits from the sage Kanwa has arrived, and
craves an immediate audience. Certainly, his Majesty ought not to
neglect a matter of sacred duty, yet I hardly like to trouble him
when he has just risen from the judgment-seat. Well, well; a
monarch's business is to sustain the world, and he must not
expect much repose; because--

  Onward, for ever onward, in his car
  The unwearied Sun pursues his daily course,
  Nor tarries to unyoke his glittering steeds.
  And, ever moving, speeds the rushing Wind
  Through boundless space, filling the universe
  With his life-giving breezes. Day and night,
  The King of Serpents on his thousand heads[76]
  Upholds the incumbent earth; and even so,
  Unceasing toil is aye the lot of kings,
  Who, in return, draw nurture from their subjects.

I will therefore deliver my message.

[_Walking on and looking about_.]

Ah! here comes the King.

  His subjects are his children; through the day,
  Like a fond father, to supply their wants,
  Incessantly he labours; wearied now,
  The monarch seeks seclusion and repose;
  E'en as the prince of elephants defies
  The sun's fierce heat, and leads the fainting herd
  To verdant pastures, ere his wayworn limbs
  He yields to rest beneath the cooling shade.

[_Approaching_.]

Victory to the King! So please your Majesty, some hermits who
live in a forest near the Snowy Mountains have arrived here,
bringing certain women with them. They have a message to deliver
from the sage Kanwa and desire an audience. I await your
Majesty's commands.

KING.                                            [_Respectfully_.

A message from the sage Kanwa, did you say?

CHAMBERLAIN.

Even so, my liege.

KING.

Tell my domestic priest Somaráta to receive the hermits with due
honour, according to the prescribed form. He may then himself
introduce them into my presence. I will await them in a place
suitable for the reception of such holy guests.

CHAMBERLAIN.

Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed.

                                                         [_Exit_.

KING.                        [_Rising and addressing his_ WARDER.

Vetravatí, lead the way to the chamber of the consecrated
fire[77].

WARDER.

This way, Sire.

KING.

[_Walking on, with the air of one oppressed by the cares of
Government_.

People are generally contented and happy when they have gained
their desires; but kings have no sooner attained the object of
their aspirations than all their troubles begin.

  'Tis a fond thought that to attain the end
  And object of ambition is to rest;
  Success doth only mitigate the fever
  Of anxious expectation; soon the fear
  Of losing what we have, the constant care
  Of guarding it, doth weary. Ceaseless toil
  Must be the lot of him who with his hands
  Supports the canopy that shields his subjects.

TWO HERALDS[78].                            [_Behind the scenes_.

May the King be victorious!

FIRST HERALD.

  Honour to him who labours day by day
  For the world's weal, forgetful of his own;
  Like some tall tree that with its stately head
  Endures the solar beam, while underneath
  It yields refreshing shelter to the weary.

SECOND HERALD.

  Let but the monarch wield his threatening rod
  And e'en the guilty tremble; at his voice
  The rebel spirit cowers; his grateful subjects
  Acknowledge him their guardian; rich and poor
  Hail him a faithful friend--a loving kinsman.

KING.

Weary as I was before, this complimentary address has refreshed
me.

                                                     [_Walks on_.

WARDER.

Here is the terrace of the hallowed fire-chamber, and yonder
stands the cow that yields the milk for the oblations. The sacred
enclosure has been recently purified, and looks clean and
beautiful. Ascend, Sire.

KING. [Leans on the shoulders of his attendants and ascends_.

Vetravatí, what can possibly be the message that the venerable
Kanwa has sent me by these hermits?

  Perchance their sacred rites have been disturbed
  By demons, or some evil has befallen
  The innocent herds, their favourites, that graze
  Within the precincts of the hermitage,
  Or haply, through my sins, some withering blight
  Has nipped the creeping plants that spread their arms
  Around the hallowed grove. Such troubled thoughts
  Crowd through my mind, and fill me with misgiving.

WARDER.

If you ask my opinion, Sire, I think the hermits merely wish to
take an opportunity of testifying their loyalty, and are
therefore come to offer homage to your majesty.

_Enter the_ HERMITS _leading_ [S']AKOONTALÁ, _attended by_ GAUTAMÍ;
_and in advance of them, the_ CHAMBERLAIN _and the_ DOMESTIC
PRIEST.

CHAMBERLAIN.

This way, reverend Sirs, this way.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA

O [S']áradwata,

  'Tis true the monarch lacks no royal grace,
  Nor ever swerves from justice; true, his people,
  Yea such as in life's humblest walks are found,
  Refrain from evil courses; still to me,
  A lonely hermit reared in solitude,
  This throng appears bewildering, and I seem
  To look upon a burning house, whose inmates
  Are running to and fro in wild dismay.

[S']ÁRADWATA.

It is natural that the first sight of the King's capital should
affect you in this manner; my own sensations are very similar.

  As one just bathed beholds the man polluted;
  As one late purified, the yet impure;
  As one awake looks on the yet unawakened;
  Or as the freeman gazes on the thrall,
  So I regard this crowd of pleasure-seekers.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

  [_Feeling a quivering sensation in her right eyelid_ [79]_, and
                                          suspecting a bad omen_.

Alas! what means this throbbing of my right eyelid?

GAUTAMÍ.

Heaven avert the evil omen, my child! May the guardian deities of
thy husband's family convert it into a sign of good fortune!

[_Walks on_.

PRIEST.

[_Pointing to the King_.

Most reverend Sirs, there stands the protector of the four
classes of the people; the guardian of the four conditions of the
priesthood[80]. He has just left the judgment-seat, and is
waiting for you. Behold him!

[S']ÁRNGARAVA

Great Bráhman, we are happy in thinking that the King's power is
exerted for the protection of all classes of his subjects. We
have not come as petitioners--we have the fullest confidence in
the generosity of his nature.

  The loftiest trees bend humbly to the ground
  Beneath the teeming burden of their fruit;
  High in the vernal sky the pregnant clouds
  Suspend their stately course, and, hanging low,
  Scatter their sparkling treasures o'er the earth;
  And such is true benevolence; the good
  Are never rendered arrogant by riches.

 WARDER.

So please your Majesty, I judge from the placid countenance of
the hermits that they have no alarming message to deliver.

KING.                                  [_Looking at [S']AKOONTALÁ_.

But the lady there--

  Who can she be, whose form of matchless grace
  Is half concealed beneath her flowing veil?
  Among the sombre hermits she appears
  Like a fresh bud 'mid sear and yellow leaves.

WARDER.

So please your Majesty, my curiosity is also roused, but no
conjecture occurs to my mind. This at least is certain, that she
deserves to be looked at more closely.

KING.

True; but it is not right to gaze at another man's wife[120].

[S']AKOONTALÁ.             [_Placing her hand on her bosom. Aside_.

O my heart, why this throbbing? Remember thy lord's affection,
and take courage.

PRIEST.                                             [_Advancing_.

These holy men have been received with all due honour. One of
them has now a message to deliver from his spiritual superior.
Will your Majesty deign to hear it?

KING.

I am all attention.

HERMITS.                                [_Extending their hands_.

Victory to the King!

KING.

Accept my respectful greeting.

HERMITS.

May the desires of your soul be accomplished!

KING.

I trust no one is molesting you in the prosecution of your
religious rites.

HERMITS.

  Who dares disturb our penitential rites
  When thou art our protector? Can the night
  Prevail to cast her shadows o'er the earth
  While the sun's beams irradiate the sky?

KING.

Such, indeed, is the very meaning of my title--'Defender of the
Just.' I trust the venerable Kanwa is in good health. The world
is interested in his well-being.

HERMITS.

Holy men have health and prosperity in their own power. He bade
us greet your Majesty, and, after kind inquiries, deliver this
message.

KING.

Let me hear his commands.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

He bade us say that he feels happy in giving his sanction to the
marriage which your Majesty contracted with this lady, his
daughter, privately and by mutual agreement. Because,

  By us thou art esteemed the most illustrious
  Of noble husbands; and [S']akoontalá,
  Virtue herself in human form revealed.
  Great Brahmá hath in equal yoke united
  A bride unto a husband worthy of her;
  Henceforth let none make blasphemous complaint
  That he is pleased with ill-assorted unions[81].

Since, therefore, she expects soon to be the mother of thy child,
receive her into thy palace, that she may perform, in conjunction
with thee, the ceremonies prescribed by religion on such an
occasion.

GAUTAMÍ.

So please your Majesty, I would add a few words; but why should
I intrude my sentiments when an opportunity of speaking my mind
has never been allowed me?

  She took no counsel with her kindred; thou
  Didst not confer with thine, but all alone
  Didst solemnize thy nuptials with thy wife.
  Together, then, hold converse; let us leave you.

[S']AKOONTALÁ                                             [_Aside_.

Ah! how I tremble for my lord's reply.

KING.

What strange proposal is this?

[S']AKOONTALÁ                                             [_Aside_.

His words are like fire to me.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA

What do I hear? Dost thou, then, hesitate? Monarch, thou art well
acquainted with the ways of the world, and knowest that

  A wife, however virtuous and discreet,
  If she live separate from her wedded lord,
  Though under shelter of her parent's roof,
  Is marked for vile suspicion. Let her dwell
  Beside her husband, though he hold her not
  In his affection. So her kinsmen will it.

KING.

Do you really mean to assert that I ever married
this lady?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                              [_Despondingly. Aside_.

O my heart, thy worst misgivings are confirmed.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Is it becoming in a monarch to depart from the rules of justice,
because he repents of his engagements?

KING.

I cannot answer a question which is based on a mere fabrication.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Such inconstancy is fortunately not common, except in men
intoxicated by power.

KING.

Is that remark aimed at me?

GAUTAMÍ.

Be not ashamed, my daughter. Let me remove thy veil for a little
space. Thy husband will then recognize thee.

                                             [_Removes her veil_.

KING.

                               [_Gazing at_ [S']AKOONTALÁ. _Aside_.

  What charms are here revealed before mine eyes!
  Truly no blemish mars the symmetry
  Of that fair form; yet can I ne'er believe
  She is my wedded wife; and like a bee
  That circles round the flower whose nectared cup
  Teems with the dew of morning, I must pause
  Ere eagerly I taste the proffered sweetness.

                                   [_Remains wrapped in thought_.

WARDER.

How admirably does our royal master's behaviour prove his regard
for justice! Who else would hesitate for a moment when good
fortune offered for his acceptance a form of such rare beauty?

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Great King, why art thou silent?

KING.

Holy men, I have revolved the matter in my mind; but the more I
think of it, the less able am I to recollect that I ever
contracted an alliance with this lady. What answer, then, can I
possibly give you when I do not believe myself to be her husband,
and I plainly see that she is soon to become a mother?

[S']AKOONTALÁ

[_Aside_.

Woe! woe! Is our very marriage to be called in question by my own
husband? Ah me! is this to be the end of all my bright visions of
wedded happiness?

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Beware!

  Beware how thou insult the holy Sage!
  Remember how he generously allowed
  Thy secret union with his foster-child;
  And how, when thou didst rob him of his treasure,
  He sought to furnish thee excuse, when rather
  He should have cursed thee for a ravisher.

[S']ÁRADWATA.

[S']árngarava, speak to him no more. [S']akoontalá,
our part is performed; we have said all we have to
say, and the King has replied in the manner thou
hast heard. It is now thy turn to give him convincing
evidence of thy marriage.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                            [_Aside_.

Since his feeling towards me has undergone a complete revolution,
what will it avail to revive old recollections? One thing is
clear--I shall soon have to mourn my own widowhood.

[_Aloud_.]

My revered husband--

[_Stops short_.]

But no--I dare not address thee by this title, since thou hast
refused to acknowledge our union. Noble descendant of Puru! It is
not worthy of thee to betray an innocent-minded girl, and disown
her in such terms, after having so lately and so solemnly
plighted thy vows to her in the hermitage.

KING.

[_Stopping his ears_.

I will hear no more. Be such a crime far from my thoughts!

  What evil spirit can possess thee, lady,
  That thou dost seek to sully my good name
  By base aspersions, like a swollen torrent,
  That, leaping from its narrow bed, o'erthrows
  The tree upon its bank, and strives to blend
  Its turbid waters with the crystal stream?

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

If, then, thou really believest me to be the wife of another, and
thy present conduct proceeds from some cloud that obscures thy
recollection, I will easily convince thee by this token.

KING.

An excellent idea!

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

[_Feeling for the ring_.

Alas! alas! woe is me! There is no ring on my finger!

                                [_Looks with anguish at_ GAUTAMÍ.

GAUTAMÍ.

The ring must have slipped off when thou wast in the act of
offering homage to the holy water of [S']achí's sacred pool, near
Sakrávatára[82].

KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.

People may well talk of the readiness of woman's invention! Here
is an instance of it.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Say, rather, of the omnipotence of fate. I will mention another
circumstance, which may yet convince thee.

KING.

By all means let me hear it at once.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

One day, while we were seated in a jasmine-bower, thou didst pour
into the hollow of thine hand some water, sprinkled by a recent
shower in the cup of a lotus-blossom--

KING.

I am listening; proceed.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

At that instant, my adopted child, the little fawn, with soft,
long eyes, came running towards us. Upon which, before tasting
the water thyself, thou didst kindly offer some to the little
creature, saying fondly:--'Drink first, gentle fawn.' But she
could not be induced to drink from the hand of a stranger; though
immediately afterwards, when I took the water in my own hand,
she drank with perfect confidence. Then, with a smile, thou didst
say;--'Every creature confides naturally in its own kind. You are
both inhabitants of the same forest, and have learnt to trust
each other.'

KING.

Voluptuaries may allow themselves to be seduced from the path of
duty by falsehoods such as these, expressed in honeyed words.

GAUTAMÍ.

Speak not thus, illustrious Prince. This lady was brought up in a
hermitage, and has never learnt deceit.

KING.

Holy matron,

  E'en in untutored brutes, the female sex
  Is marked by inborn subtlety--much more
  In beings gifted with intelligence.
  The wily Koïl[83], ere towards the sky
  She wings her sportive flight, commits her eggs
  To other nests, and artfully consigns
  The rearing of her little ones to strangers.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.                                          [_Angrily_.

Dishonourable man, thou judgest of others by thine own evil
heart. Thou, at least, art unrivalled in perfidy, and standest
alone--a base deceiver in the garb of virtue and religion--like a
deep pit whose yawning mouth is concealed by smiling flowers.

KING.                                                   [_Aside_.

Her anger, at any rate, appears genuine, and makes me almost
doubt whether I am in the right. For indeed,

  When I had vainly searched my memory,
  And so with stern severity denied
  The fabled story of our secret loves,
  Her brows, that met before in graceful curves,
  Like the arched weapon of the god of love,
  Seemed by her frown dissevered; while the fire
  Of sudden anger kindled in her eyes.

[_Aloud_.]

My good lady, Dushyanta's character is well known to all. I
comprehend not your meaning.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

Well do I deserve to be thought a harlot for having in the
innocence of my heart, and out of the confidence I reposed in a
Prince of Puru's race, entrusted my honour to a man whose mouth
distils honey, while his heart is full of poison.

       [_Covers her face with her mantle, and bursts into tears_.

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Thus it is that burning remorse must ever follow rash actions
which might have been avoided, and for which one has only one's
self to blame.

  Not hastily should marriage be contracted,
  And specially in secret. Many a time,
  In hearts that know not each the other's fancies,
  Fond love is changed into most bitter hate.

KING.

How now! Do you give credence to this woman rather than to me,
that you heap such accusations on me?

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.                                    [_Sarcastically_.

That would be too absurd, certainly. You have heard the
proverb:--

  Hold in contempt the innocent words of those
  Who from their infancy have known no guile;
  But trust the treacherous counsels of the man
  Who makes a very science of deceit.

KING.

Most veracious Bráhman, grant that you are in the right, what end
would be gained by betraying this lady?

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Ruin.

KING.

No one will believe that a Prince of Puru's race would seek to
ruin others or himself.

[S']ÁRADWATA.

This altercation is idle, [S']árngarava. We have executed the
commission of our preceptor; come, let us return.

                                                  [_To the_ KING.

  [S']akoontalá is certainly thy bride;
  Receive her or reject her, she is thine.
  Do with her, King, according to thy pleasure--
  The husband o'er the wife is absolute.

Go on before us, Gautamí.

                                               [_They move away_.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

What! is it not enough to have been betrayed by this perfidious
man? Must you also forsake me, regardless of my tears and
lamentations?

                                      [_Attempts to follow them_.

GAUTAMÍ.                                             [_Stopping_.

My son [S']árngarava, see! [S']akoontalá is following us, and with
tears implores us not to leave her. Alas! poor child, what will
she do here with a cruel husband who casts her from him?

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

                                  [_Turning angrily towards her_.

Wilful woman, dost thou seek to be independent of thy lord?

                               [[S']AKOONTALÁ _trembles with fear_.

[S']akoontalá!

  If thou art really what the King proclaims thee,
  How can thy father e'er receive thee back
  Into his house and home? but if thy conscience
  Be witness to thy purity of soul,
  E'en should thy husband to a handmaid's lot
  Condemn thee, thou may'st cheerfully endure it.
  When ranked among the number of his household.

Thy duty therefore is to stay. As for us, we must return
immediately.

KING.

Deceive not this lady, my good hermit, by any such expectations.

  The moon expands the lotus of the night,
  The rising sun awakes the lily; each
  Is with his own contented. Even so
  The virtuous man is master of his passions,
  And from another's wife averts his gaze[120].

[S']ÁRNGARAVA.

Since thy union with another woman has rendered thee oblivious of
thy marriage with [S']akoontalá, whence this fear of losing thy
character for constancy and virtue?

KING.                                  [_To his domestic_ PRIEST.

You must counsel me, revered Sir, as to my course of action.
Which of the two evils involves the greater or less sin?

  Whether by some dark veil my mind be clouded.
  Or this designing woman speak untruly,
  I know not. Tell me, must I rather be
  The base disowner of my wedded wife,
  Or the defiling and defiled adulterer?

PRIEST.                                    [_After deliberation_.

You must take an intermediate course.

KING.

What course, revered Sir? Tell me at once.

PRIEST.

I will provide an asylum for the lady in my own house until the
birth of her child; and my reason, if you ask me, is this:
Soothsayers have predicted that your first-born will have
universal dominion. Now, if the hermit's daughter bring forth a
son with the discus or mark of empire in the lines of his
hand[84], you must admit her immediately into your royal
apartments with great rejoicings; if not, then determine to send
her back as soon as possible to her father.

KING.  I bow to the decision of my spiritual advisor.

PRIEST.

Daughter, follow me.

[S']AKOONTALÁ.

O divine earth, open and receive me into thy bosom!

[_Exit_ [S']AKOONTALÁ _weeping, with the_ PRIEST _and the_ HERMITS.
_The_ KING _remains absorbed in thinking of her, though the curse
still clouds his recollection_.

A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

A miracle! a miracle!

KING.

                                                    [_Listening_.

What has happened now?

PRIEST.                  [_Entering with an air of astonishment_.

Great Prince, a stupendous prodigy has just occurred.

KING.

What is it?

PRIEST.

May it please your Majesty, so soon as Kanwa's pupils had
departed, [S']akoontalá, her eyes all bathed in tears, with
outstretched arms, bewailed her cruel fate--

KING.

Well, well, what happened then?

PRIEST.

  When suddenly a shining apparition,
  In female shape, descended from the skies,
  Near the nymph's pool, and bore her up to heaven.

[_All remain motionless with astonishment_.

KING.

My good priest, from the very first I declined having anything to
do with this matter. It is now all over, and we can never, by our
conjectures, unravel the mystery; let it rest; go, seek repose.

PRIEST.

                                          [_Looking at the_ KING.

Be it so. Victory to the King!

                                                         [_Exit_.

KING.

Vetravatí, I am tired out; lead the way to the bedchamber.

WARDER.

This way, Sire.

                                               [_They move away_.

KING.

  Do what I will, I cannot call to mind
  That I did e'er espouse the sage's daughter;
  Therefore I have disowned her; yet 'tis strange
  How painfully my agitated heart
  Bears witness to the truth of her assertion,
  And makes me credit her against my judgment.

                                                       [_Exeunt_.

       *       *       *       *       *




PRELUDE TO ACT VI.

SCENE.--_A Street_.

_Enter the King's brother-in-law as_ SUPERINTENDENT _of the city
police; and with him_ TWO CONSTABLES, _dragging a poor_
FISHERMAN, _who has his hands tied behind his back_.

BOTH THE CONSTABLES.                    [_Striking the prisoner_.

Take that for a rascally thief that you are; and now tell us, sirrah,
where you found this ring--aye, the King's own signet-ring. See, here
is the royal name engraved on the setting of the jewel.

FISHERMAN.                            [_With a gesture of alarm_.

Mercy! kind sirs, mercy! I did not steal it; indeed I did not.

FIRST CONSTABLE.

Oh! then I suppose the King took you for some fine Bráhman, and
made you a present of it?

FISHERMAN.

Only hear me. I am but a poor fisherman, living at Sakrávatára--

SECOND CONSTABLE.

Scoundrel, who ever asked you, pray, for a history of your birth
and parentage?

SUPERINTENDENT.                      [_To one of the_ CONSTABLES.

Súchaka, let the fellow tell his own story from the beginning.
Don't interrupt him.

BOTH CONSTABLES.

As you please, master. Go on, then, sirrah, and say what you've
got to say.

FISHERMAN.

You see in me a poor man, who supports his family by catching
fish with nets, hooks, and the like.

SUPERINTENDENT.                                      [_Laughing_.

A most refined occupation, certainly[85]!

FISHERMAN.

Blame me not for it, master,

  The father's occupation, though despised
  By others, casts no shame upon the son,
  And he should not forsake it[86]. Is the priest
  Who kills the animal for sacrifice
  Therefore deemed cruel? Sure a low-born man
  May, though a fisherman, be tender-hearted.

SUPERINTENDENT.

Well, well; go on with your story.

FISHERMAN.

One day I was cutting open a large carp[87] I had just hooked,
when the sparkle of a jewel caught my eye, and what should I find
in the fish's maw but that ring! Soon afterwards, when I was
offering it for sale, I was seized by your honours. Now you know
everything. Whether you kill me, or whether you let me go, this
is the true account of how the ring came into my possession.

SUPERINTENDENT.                      [_To one of the_ CONSTABLES.

Well, Jánuka, the rascal emits such a fishy odour that I have no
doubt of his being a fisherman; but we must inquire a little more
closely into this queer story about the finding of the ring.
Come, we'll take him before the King's household.

BOTH CONSTABLES.

Very good, master. Get on with you, you cutpurse.

                                                  [_All move on_.

SUPERINTENDENT.

Now attend, Súchaka; keep your guard here at the gate; and hark
ye, sirrahs, take good care your prisoner does not escape, while
I go in and lay the whole story of the discovery of this ring
before the King in person. I will soon return and let you know
his commands.

BOTH CONSTABLES.

Go in, master, by all means; and may you find favour in the
King's sight.

[_Exit_ SUPERINTENDENT.  FIRST CONSTABLE.

                                            [_After an interval_.

I say, Jánuka, the Superintendent is a long time away.

SECOND CONSTABLE.

Aye, aye; kings are not to be got at so easily. Folks must bide
the proper opportunity.

FIRST CONSTABLE.

Jánuka, my fingers itch to strike the first blow at this royal
victim here. We must kill him with all the honours, you know. I
long to begin binding the flowers round his head[88].

                   [_Pretends to strike a blow at the_ FISHERMAN.

FISHERMAN.

Your Honour surely will not put an innocent man to a cruel death.

SECOND CONSTABLE.

There's our Superintendent at last, I declare. See! he is coming
towards us with a paper in his hand. We shall soon know the
King's command; so prepare, my fine fellow, either to become food
for the vultures, or to make acquaintance with some hungry cur.

SUPERINTENDENT.

                                                     [_Entering_.

Ho, there, Súchaka! set the fisherman at liberty, I tell you. His
story about the ring is all correct.  SÚCHAKA.

Oh! very good, Sir; as you please.

SECOND CONSTABLE.

The fellow had one foot in hell, and now here he is in the land
of the living.

                                                 [_Releases him_.

FISHERMAN.

                                 [_Bowing to the_ SUPERINTENDENT.

Now, master, what think you of my way of getting a livelihood?

SUPERINTENDENT.

Here, my good man, the King desired me to present you with this
purse. It contains a sum of money equal to the full value of the
ring.

                                          [_Gives him the money_.

FISHERMAN.

                                         [_Taking it and bowing_.

His Majesty does me too great honour.

SÚCHAKA.

You may well say so. He might as well have taken you from the
gallows to seat you on his state elephant.

JÁNUKA.

Master, the King must value the ring very highly, or he would
never have sent such a sum of money to this ragamuffin.

SUPERINTENDENT.

I don't think he prizes it as a costly jewel so much as a
memorial of some person he tenderly loves. The moment it was
shown to him he became much agitated, though in general he
conceals his feelings.  SÚCHAKA.

Then you must have done a great service--

JÁNUKA.

Yes, to this husband of a fish-wife.

                             [_Looks enviously at the_ FISHERMAN.

FISHERMAN.

Here's half the money for you, my masters. It will serve to
purchase the flowers you spoke of, if not to buy me your
good-will.

JÁNUKA.

Well, now, that's just as it should be.

SUPERINTENDENT.

My good fisherman, you are an excellent fellow, and I begin to
feel quite a regard for you. Let us seal our first friendship
over a glass of good liquor. Come along to the next wine-shop,
and we'll drink your health.

ALL.

By all means.

                                                       [_Exeunt_.

       *       *       *       *       *




ACT VI.

SCENE.--_The Garden of a Palace.

The nymph_ SÁNUMATÍ _is seen descending in a celestial car_.

SÁNUMATÍ.

Behold me just arrived from attending in my proper turn at the
nymph's pool, where I have left the other nymphs to perform their
ablutions, whilst I seek to ascertain, with my own eyes, how it
fares with King Dushyanta. My connexion with the nymph Menaká has
made her daughter [S']akoontalá dearer to me than my own flesh and
blood; and Menaká it was who charged me with this errand on her
daughter's behalf.

[_Looking round in all directions_.]

How is it that I see no preparations in the King's household for
celebrating the great vernal festival[89]? I could easily
discover the reason by my divine faculty of meditation[134]; but
respect must be shown to the wishes of my friend. How then shall
I arrive at the truth? I know what I will do. I will become
invisible, and place myself near those two maidens who are
tending the plants in the garden.

                               [_Descends and takes her station_.

_Enter a_ MAIDEN, _who stops in front of a mango-tree, and gazes
at the blossom. Another_ MAIDEN _is seen behind her_.

FIRST MAIDEN.

Hail to thee, lovely harbinger of spring! The varied radiance of
thy opening flowers Is welcome to my sight. I bid thee hail,
Sweet mango, soul of this enchanting season.

SECOND MAIDEN.

Parabhritiká, what are you saying there to yourself?

FIRST MAIDEN.

Dear Madhukariká, am I not named after the Koïl[90]? and does not
the Koïl sing for joy at the first appearance of the mango-blossom?

SECOND MAIDEN.            [_Approaching hastily, with transport_.

What! is spring really come?

FIRST MAIDEN.

Yes, indeed, Madhukariká, and with it the season of joy, love,
and song.

SECOND MAIDEN.

Let me lean upon you, dear, while I stead on tiptoe and pluck a
blossom, of the mango, that I may present it as an offering to
the god of love.

FIRST MAIDEN.

Provided you let me have half the reward which the god will
bestow in return.

SECOND MAIDEN.

To be sure you shall, and that without asking. Are we not one in
heart and soul, though divided in body?

[_Leans on her friend and plucks a mango-blossom_.]

Ah! here is a bud just bursting into flower. It diffuses a
delicious perfume, though not yet quite expanded.

[_Joining her hands reverentially_.]

  God of the bow, who with spring's choicest flowers
  Dost point thy five unerring shafts[91]; to thee
  I dedicate this blossom; let it serve
  To barb thy truest arrow; be its mark
  Some youthful heart that pines to be beloved.

                                  [_Throws down a mango-blossom_.

CHAMBERLAIN.

                        [_Entering in a hurried manner, angrily_.

Hold there, thoughtless woman. What are you about, breaking off
those mango-blossoms, when the King has forbidden the celebration
of the spring festival?

BOTH MAIDENS.                                         [_Alarmed_.

Pardon us, kind Sir, we have heard nothing of it.

CHAMBERLAIN.

You have heard nothing of it? Why, all the vernal plants and
shrubs, and the very birds that lodge in their branches, show
more respect to the King's order than you do.

  Yon mango-blossoms, though long since expanded,
  Gather no down upon their tender crests;
  The flower still lingers in the amaranth[92],
  Imprisoned in its bud; the tuneful Koïl,
  Though winter's chilly dews be overpast,
  Suspends the liquid volume of his song
  Scarce uttered in his throat; e'en Love, dismayed,
  Restores the half-drawn arrow to his quiver.

BOTH MAIDENS.

The mighty power of King Dushyanta is not to be disputed.

FIRST MAIDEN.

It is but a few days since Mitrávasu, the King's brother-in-law,
sent us to wait upon his Majesty; and, during the whole of our
sojourn here, we have been entrusted with the charge of the royal
pleasure-grounds. We are therefore strangers in this place, and
heard nothing of the order till you informed us of it.

CHAMBERLAIN.

Well then, now you know it, take care you don't continue your
preparations.

BOTH MAIDENS.

But tell us, kind Sir, why has the King prohibited the usual
festivities? We are curious to hear, if we may.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                              [_Aside_.

Men are naturally fond of festive entertainments. There must be
some good reason for the prohibition.

CHAMBERLAIN.

The whole affair is now public; why should I not speak of it?
Has not the gossip about the King's rejection of [S']akoontalá
reached your ears yet?

BOTH MAIDENS.

Oh yes, we heard the story from the King's brother-in-law, as
far, at least, as the discovery of the ring.

CHAMBERLAIN.

Then there is little more to tell you. As soon as the King's
memory was restored by the sight of his own ring, he exclaimed:
'Yes, it is all true. I remember now my secret marriage with
[S']akoontalá. When I repudiated her, I had lost my recollection!'
Ever since that moment, he has yielded himself a prey to the
bitterest remorse.

  He loathes his former pleasures; he rejects
  The daily homage of his ministers;
  On his lone couch he tosses to and fro,
  Courting repose in vain. Whene'er he meets
  The ladies of his palace, and would fain
  Address them with politeness, he confounds
  Their names; or, calling them '[S']akoontalá,'
  Is straightway silent and abashed with shame.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

To me this account is delightful.

CHAMBERLAIN.

In short, the King is so completely out of his mind that the
festival has been prohibited.

BOTH MAIDENS.

Perfectly right.

A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

The King! the King! This way, Sire, this way.

CHAMBERLAIN.                                        [_Listening_.

Oh! here comes his Majesty in this direction. Pass on, maidens;
attend to your duties.

BOTH MAIDENS.

We will, sir.

                                                       [_Exeunt_.

_Enter King_ DUSHYANTA, _dressed in deep mourning, attended his
Jester_, MÁ[T.]HAVYA, _and preceded by_ VETRAVATÍ.

CHAMBERLAIN.                               [_Gazing at the_ KING.

Well, noble forms are certainly pleasing, under all varieties of
outward circumstances. The King's person is as charming as ever,
notwithstanding his sorrow of mind.

  Though but a single golden bracelet spans
  His wasted arm; though costly ornaments
  Have given place to penitential weeds;
  Though oft-repeated sighs have blanched his lips,
  And robbed them of their bloom; though sleepless care
  And carking thought have dimmed his beaming eye;
  Yet does his form, by its inherent lustre,
  Dazzle the gaze; and, like a priceless gem
  Committed to some cunning polisher,
  Grow more effulgent by the loss of substance.

SÁNUMATÍ.                          [_Aside. Looking at the_ KING.

Now that I have seen him, I can well understand why [S']akoontalá
should pine after such a man, in spite of his disdainful
rejection of her.

KING.              [_Walking slowly up and down in deep thought_.

  When fatal lethargy o'erwhelmed my soul,
  My loved one strove to rouse me, but in vain;
  And now, when I would fain in slumber deep
  Forget myself, full soon remorse doth wake me.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

My poor [S']akoontalá's sufferings are very similar.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.                                              [_Aside_.

He is taken with another attack of this odious [S']akoontalá-fever.
How shall we ever cure him?

CHAMBERLAIN.                                      [_Approaching_.

Victory to the King! Great Prince, the royal pleasure-grounds
have been put in order. Your Majesty can resort to them for
exercise and amusement whenever you think proper.

KING.

Vetravatí, tell the worthy Pi[S']una, my prime minister, from me,
that I am so exhausted by want of sleep that I cannot sit on the
judgment-seat to-day. If any case of importance be brought before
the tribunal, he must give it his best attention, and inform me
of the circumstances by letter.

VETRAVATÍ.

Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed.

                                                         [_Exit_.

KING.                                      [_To the CHAMBERLAIN_.

And you, Vátáyana, may go about your own affairs.

CHAMBERLAIN.

I will, Sire.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Now that you have rid yourself of these troublesome fellows, you
can enjoy the delightful coolness of your pleasure-grounds
without interruption.

KING.

Ah! my dear friend, there is an old adage:--'When affliction has
a mind to enter, she will find a crevice somewhere;' and it is
verified in me.

  Scarce is my soul delivered from the cloud
  That darkened its remembrance of the past,
  When lo! the heart-born deity of love
  With yonder blossom of the mango barbs
  His keenest shaft, and aims it at my breast.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Well, then, wait a moment; I will soon demolish Master Káma's[47]
arrow with a cut of my cane.

           [_Raises his stick and strikes off the mango-blossom_.

KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.

That will do. I see very well the god of love is not a match for
a Bráhman. And now, my dear friend, where shall I sit down, that
I may enchant my sight by gazing on the twining plants, which
seem to remind me of the graceful shape of my beloved?

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Don't you remember? you told your personal attendant, Chaturiká,
that you would pass the heat of the day in the jasmine-bower; and
commanded her to bring the likeness of your queen [S']akoontalá,
sketched with your own hand.

KING.

True. The sight of her picture will refresh my soul. Lead the way
to the arbour.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

This way, Sire.

                           [_Both move on, followed by_ SÁNUMATÍ.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Here we are at the jasmine-bower. Look, it has a marble seat, and
seems to bid us welcome with its offerings of delicious flowers.
You have only to enter and sit down.

                               [_Both enter and seat themselves_.

SÁNUMATÍ

[_Aside_.

I will lean against these young jasmines. I can easily, from
behind them, glance at my friend's picture, and will then hasten
to inform her of her husband's ardent affection.

                          [_Stands leaning against the creepers_.

KING.

Oh! my dear friend, how vividly all the circumstances of my union
with [S']akoontalá present themselves to my recollection at this
moment! But tell me now how it was that, between the time of my
leaving her in the hermitage and my subsequent rejection of her,
you never breathed her name to me? True, you were not by my side
when I disowned her; but I had confided to you the story of my
love, and you were acquainted with every particular. Did it pass
out of your mind as it did out of mine?

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

No, no; trust me for that. But, if you remember, when you had
finished telling me about it, you added that I was not to take
the story in earnest, for that you were not really in love with a
country girl, but were only jesting; and I was dull and
thick-headed enough to believe you. But so fate decreed, and
there is no help for it.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

Exactly.

KING.                                      [_After deep thought_.

My dear friend, suggest some relief for my misery.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Come, come, cheer up; why do you give way? Such weakness is
unworthy of you. Great men never surrender themselves to
uncontrolled grief. Do not mountains remain unshaken even in a
gale of wind?

KING.

How can I be otherwise than inconsolable, when I call to mind the
agonized demeanour of the dear one on the occasion of my
disowning her?

  When cruelly I spurned her from my presence,
  She fain had left me; but the young recluse,
  Stern as the Sage, and with authority
  As from his saintly master, in a voice
  That brooked not contradiction, bade her stay.
  Then through her pleading eyes, bedimmed with tears,
  She cast on me one long reproachful look,
  Which like a poisoned shaft torments me still.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

Alas! such is the force of self-reproach following a rash
action. But his anguish only rejoices me.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA

An idea has just struck me. I should not wonder if some celestial
being had carried her off to heaven.

KING.

Very likely. Who else would have dared to lay a finger on a wife,
the idol of her husband? It is said that Menaká, the nymph of
heaven, gave her birth. The suspicion has certainly crossed my
mind that some of her celestial companions may have taken her to
their own abode.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

His present recollection of every circumstance of her history
does not surprise me so much as his former forgetfulness.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

If that's the case, you will be certain to meet her before long.

KING.

Why?

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

No father and mother can endure to see a daughter suffering the
pain of separation from her husband.

KING. Oh! my dear Má[T.]Havya,

  Was it a dream? or did some magic dire,
  Dulling my senses with a strange delusion,
  O'ercome my spirit? or did destiny,
  Jealous of my good actions, mar their fruit,
  And rob me of their guerdon? It is past,
  Whate'er the spell that bound me. Once again
  Am I awake, but only to behold
  The precipice o'er which my hopes have fallen.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Do not despair in this manner. Is not this very ring a proof that
what has been lost may be unexpectedly found?

KING.                                      [_Gazing at the ring_.

Ah! this ring, too, has fallen from a station not easily
regained, and I offer it my sympathy. O gem,

  The punishment we suffer is deserved,
  And equal is the merit of our works,
  When such our common doom. Thou didst enjoy
  The thrilling contact of those slender fingers,
  Bright as the dawn; and now how changed thy lot!

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

Had it found its way to the hand of any other person, then indeed
its fate would have been deplorable.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Pray, how did the ring ever come upon her hand at all?

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

I myself am curious to know.

KING.

You shall hear. When I was leaving my beloved [S']akoontalá that I
might return to my own capital, she said to me, with tears in her
eyes: 'How long will it be ere my lord send for me to his palace
and make me his queen?'

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Well, what was your reply?

KING.

Then I placed the ring on her finger, and thus addressed her:--

Repeat each day one letter of the name Engraven on this gem; ere
thou hast reckoned The tale of syllables, my minister Shall come
to lead thee to thy husband's palace.

But, hard-hearted man that I was, I forgot to fulfil my promise,
owing to the infatuation that took possession of me.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

A pleasant arrangement! Fate, however, ordained that the
appointment should not be kept.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

But how did the ring contrive to pass into the stomach of that
carp which the fisherman caught and was cutting up?

KING.

It must have slipped from my [S']akoontalá's hand, and fallen into
the stream of the Ganges, while she was offering homage to the
water of [S']achí's holy pool.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.

Very likely.

SÁNUMATÍ.                                               [_Aside_.

Hence it happened, I suppose, that the King, always fearful of
committing the least injustice, came to doubt his marriage with
my poor [S']akoontalá. But why should affection so strong as his
stand in need of any token of recognition?

KING.

Let me now address a few words of reproof to this ring.

MÁ[T.]HAVYA.                                              [_Aside_.

He is going stark mad, I verily believe.

KING.

  Hear me, then dull and undiscerning bauble!
  For so it argues thee, that thou could'st leave
  The slender fingers of her hand, to sink
  Beneath the waters. Yet what marvel is it
  That thou should'st lack discernment? let me rather
  Heap curses on myself, who, thoughail of a dragon, was decapitated by Vishnu
at the churning of the ocean; but, as he had previously tasted of
the Amrit or nectar reproduced at that time, he was thereby
rendered immortal, and his head and tail, retaining their
separate existence, were transferred to the stellar sphere. The
head was called Ráhu, and became the cause of eclipses, by
endeavouring at various times to swallow the sun and moon. So in
the Hitopade[s']a, line 192, the moon is said to be eaten by Ráhu.
With regard to the love of the Moon for Rohiní, the fourth lunar
constellation, see note 53.

123. _All unadorned_.

That is, from the absence of colouring or paint.

124. _The power of darkness_.

According to Hindú philosophy there are three qualities or
properties which together make up or dominate humanity: 1.
_Sattwa_, 'excellence' or 'goodness' (quiescence), whence
proceed truth, knowledge, purity, etc. 2. _Rajas_, 'passion'
(activity), which produces lust, pride, falsehood, etc., and is
the cause of pain. 3. _Tamas_, 'darkness' (inertia), whence
proceed ignorance, infatuation, delusion, mental blindness, etc.

125. _Children of Brahmá's sons_.

Ka[s']yapa and Adití were the children of Maríchi and Daksha
respectively, and these last were the sons of Brahmá.

126. _The ruler of the triple world_.

That is, Indra, lord of heaven, earth, and the lower regions.
Compare notes 110, 113.

127. _Whom Vishnu, greater than the Self-existent_.

Vishnu, as Náráyana, or the Supreme Spirit, moved over the waters
before the creation of the world, and from his navel came the lotus
from which Brahmá, the World's Creator, here called the Self-existent,
sprang. As Vishnu, the Preserver, he became incarnate in various
forms; and chose Ka[s']yapa and Adití, from whom all human beings
were descended, as his medium of incarnation, especially in the Avatár
in which he was called Upendra, 'Indra's younger brother.' Hence it
appears that the worshippers of Vishnu exalt him above the Creator.

128. _The earth's seven sea-girt isles_.

According to the mythical geography of the Hindús, the earth
consisted of seven islands, or rather insular continents,
surrounded by seven seas. That inhabited by men was called
Jambudwípa, and was in the centre, having in the middle of it the
sacred mountain Meru or Sumeru, a kind of Mount Olympus inhabited
by the gods. About Jambu flowed the sea of salt-water which
extends to the second Dwípa, called Plaksha, which is in its turn
surrounded by a sea of sugar-cane juice. And so with the five
other Dwípas, viz. Sálmali, Ku[S']a, Krauncha, [S']áka, and Pushkara,
which are severally surrounded by the seas of wine, clarified
butter, curds, milk, and fresh water.

129. _Bharata_.

The name Bharata is derived from the root bhri (fero),'to
support.' Many Indian princes were so named, but the most
celebrated was this son of Dushyanta and [S']akoontalá, who so
extended his empire that from him the whole of India was called
Bharata-varsha or Bhárata-varsha; and whose descendants, the sons
of Dhritaráshtra and Pándu, by their quarrels, formed the subject
of the great epic poem called Mahá-bhárata. The Hindús at the
present day continue to call India by the name Bhárata-varsha.

180. _The Sage Bharata_.

The Bharata here intended must not be confounded with the young
prince. He was a holy sage, the director or manager of the gods'
dramas, and inventor of theatrical representations in general. He
wrote a work containing precepts and rules relating to every
branch of dramatic writing, which appears to have been lost, but
is constantly quoted by the commentators. (See p. xxix.)

131. _Saraswatí_.

She is the goddess of speech and eloquence, patroness of the arts
and sciences, and inventress of the Sanskrit language. There is a
festival still held in her honour for two days, about February in
every year, when no Hindú will touch a pen or write a letter. The
courts are all closed accordingly.

132. _The purple self-existent god_.

[S']iva is usually represented as borne on a bull; his colour, as
well as that of the animal he rides, being white, to denote the
purity of Justice, over which he presides. In his destroying
capacity, he is characterized by the quality 'darkness,' and
named Rudra, Kála, etc., when his colour is said to be purple or
black. Some refer the epithet 'purple' to the colour of his
throat; compare note 96. Self-existent, although properly a name
of the Supreme Being (Brahmá), is applied both to Vishnu and
[S']iva by their votaries.

134. _Whose vital Energy_.

That is, [S']iva's wife, Párvatí, who was supposed to personify his
energy or active power. Exemption from further transmigration,
and absorption into the divine soul, was the _summum bonum_ of
Hindú philosophy. Compare note 37.

135. _By my divine faculty of meditation_.

Celestial beings were endowed with a mental faculty (called
dhyána, pranidhána, etc.), which enabled them to arrive at the
knowledge of present and future events.

136. _A roseate dye wherewith to stain The lady's feet_.

That is, the soles of her feet. It was customary for Hindú ladies
to stain the soles of their feet of a red colour with the dye
made from lac--a minute insect bearing some resemblance to the
cochineal--which punctures the bark of the Indian fig-tree, and
surrounds itself with the milky resinous juice of that tree.
This custom is a alluded to in one of Paterson's Hindú odes--

  'The rose that humbly bowed to meet,
  With glowing lips, her hallowed feet,
  And lent them all its bloom.'

See Megha-dúta (Edit. Johnson), p. 32.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
